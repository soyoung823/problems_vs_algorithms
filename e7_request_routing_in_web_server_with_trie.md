Time complexity:
    insert: O(n) when n is the length of input path. 
    find: O(m) when m is the length of path segments list.

Space complexity:
    insert: O(n) since n lengthed input path can be stored by all path segment strings in the trie nodes.
    find: O(n) when m is the length of input path.
