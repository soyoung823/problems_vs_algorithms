1. Problem explanations
The goal is to implement the function that sorts the array with only 0, 1, and 2 in a single traversal.

2. Complexity explanations
Time complexity: O(n) since the procedure uses a while loop to visit n elements.

Space complexity: O(1) since it's in place swapping. Only use pointers.
