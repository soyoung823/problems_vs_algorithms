1. Problem explanations
The goal is to find the square root (floor value) of the integer without using any Python library.
The expected time complexity is O(log(n)).

2. Complexity explanations
Time complexity: O(log(n)) since the procedure uses a binary search algorithm to make faster up to O(log(n)).

Space complexity: O(1) because of no extra space use.
