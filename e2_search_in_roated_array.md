1. Problem explanations
The goal is to implement the function that the given sorted array might be rotated at some random pivot point.
If you find the target, return the target index otherwise -1.
The runtime should be in O(log(n)).

2. Compleixity explanations
Time complexity: O(log(n)) since the implementation uses a binary search (O(log(n))).

Space complexity: O(1) since no extra space is needed.
