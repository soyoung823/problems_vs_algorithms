TrieNode:
Time complexity: 
    insert: O(1) since the procedure uses a constant time dictionary insertion.

space complexity:
    O(n) since n length of nodes are growing 

Trie:
Time complexity:
    insert: O(n) since the procedure uses a for loop and visit n nodes.
    find: O(m) if the length of search string is m since each word look up needs O(1) in dictionary.

space complexity:
    O(n) since n length of nodes are growing
